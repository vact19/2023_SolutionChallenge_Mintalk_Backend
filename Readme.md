# Introducing Mintalk.
Mintalk was created to alleviate mental pain and suffering.

### Frontend Github
https://github.com/GDSC-SKHU/Solution-Team4-minTalk-FrontEnd

## The features of Mintalk include
- Self-psychological tests
- Real-time chat with counselors
- Matching with psychiatrists.

## 1. We would like to share the problem that we are trying to solve.

We developed the site with a focus on situations where the happiness index is significantly low. Therefore, we developed features to eliminate the distance or discomfort people may feel when seeking psychological counseling, which can help improve mental health. We believed that many people could benefit from psychological counseling if we could address the stigma or discomfort that people may feel about seeking such help. By doing so, we hope to alleviate the mental pain and suffering of many people.

## 2. How do we plan to solve the problem?

I believe that if we can develop self-tests with an element of fun and allow users to converse with mental health professionals as if they were chatting with friends, they will be able to have a more intuitive understanding of their own mental health. Additionally, if people start saying things like 'Go take a test on Mintalk' naturally and positively, then I believe our site can actually contribute to improving people's mental health.

## 3. Please take a look at our service.
